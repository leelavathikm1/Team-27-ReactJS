   - **Step 2: Design the Data Structure**  
     Create an array to store book objects, each with properties for title, author, and ISBN. Optionally, use localStorage for persistent data.  
   - **Step 3: Create Operation**  
     Build a form with input fields for title, author, and ISBN. Add an event listener to the form’s submit button to capture input data, create a book object, and append it to the array. Save the updated array to localStorage if used.  
   - **Step 4: Read Operation**
